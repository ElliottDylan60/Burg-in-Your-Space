# Burg-in-Your-Space
Music Player Created and Designed for KCWU 88.1 The Burg. This program is currently running on Campus at CWU built by KCWU and branded 
as the 'Burg in Your Space'. This program is a music player that pulls music from a webserver on campus with music playlists full of songs and sweepers.

Some of the code in the player does not function, for instance the automatic email function no longer exists as SMTP requried passwords in plain text.
